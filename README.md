To do List Site

This was my second project. While doing the site, i was still learning to code with HTML, CSS and JS. This second project i worked on my own to add in my future CV, unlike the first projeect, which i did beacuse of a course (ONE - Alura) i took part on.

In this project i tryied to do a "To-Do enhanced List", not only a simple list with items users can add and mark down, but a list with some more personality and more options for user to work on and change some interface if desires.

This document will be updated with the characteristics of the program as it gets ready.

by now the program is able to:

|*add new section of itens to be inserted by the user ("+" button)*|
|*-this section has a title, which can be omitted or deleted (by hitting "backspace")*|
|*-when an item is filled, by hitting "enter" a new item can be inserted*|
|*-is a item area is empty, it is suposed to be automaticly removed bi hiting backspace*|
|*-each item has a checkbox to mark when the respective task has already been done*|
|*-when the checkbox is marked, the item text gets lined-through*|
|*-limitless sections of itens and limitless itens to be inserted in each section*|
