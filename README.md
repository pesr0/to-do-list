To do List Site

This was my second project. While doing the site, i was still learning to code with HTML, CSS and JS. This second project i worked on my own to add in my future portfolio, unlike the first project, which i did beacuse of a course (ONE - Alura) i took part on.

In this project i tryied to do a "To-Do enhanced List", not only a simple list with items users can add and mark down, but a list with some more personality and more options for user to work on and change some interface if it is desired.

This document will be updated with it capabilities as it gets ready.

by now the program is able to:

|*-add new section of itens to be inserted by the user ("+" button)*|
|*-when an item is filled, by hitting "enter" a new item is inserted*|
|*-if a item area is empty, it is suposed to be automatically removed by hiting backspace*|
|*-each item has a checkbox to mark when the respective task has already been done*|
|*-when the checkbox is marked, the item text gets lined-through*|
|*-limitless sections of itens and limitless itens to be inserted in each section*|
|*-implemented search bar which you can type a term, word, or letter and the site you display only the containers which havve te content typed*|
|*-help guide with some instructions added, just click on the ? mark and it will display*|
|*-edit mode, which make it possible to delete itens and boxes of inputs*|
|*-when the task in the box are completed (checked), the box gets green, indicating that all have been done there*|
